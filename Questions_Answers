1. Describe how the assembly changes with different k-mer values using the assembly statistics you have collected. 
How does the contig length distribution change? 

	As we increased the kmer the number of contigs got fewer, but their N50 got larger. 
	Based on looking at the graphs, the visual distribution of contig lengths got more 
	spread out as there were larger contigs present in the graphs of larger kmers. 

2. How does an increased coverage cutoff affect the assembly? 
What is happening to the de Bruijin graph when you change the value of this parameter? 
How does velvet calculate its value for ‘auto’? 

	Comparing to the unmodified k49 distribution, any specification of coverage seems to optimize assembly.
	As the coverage increased, the max contig size got much smaller , probably in an attempt to assemble more reads.
	But although the max is smaller the mean and N50 are greater. This indicates that the assembled reads are optimized 
	to fit better into the assembly and assemble end to end in a more formated fashion.
	The auto coverage cutoff seems to be very low as the number of contigs present was more than the 20x and the mean 
	contig length was less.

3. How does increasing minimum contig length affect your contig length distribution and N50?

	Increasing the minimum does exactly as one would expect. It obviously increases the N50 because, and because we are working 
	with generally larger contigs the mean is also increased. However the exlusion of shorter contigs drastically drops the ammount
	of contigs we can work with in the assembly, and the coverage follows the drop in turn.
